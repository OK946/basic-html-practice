        <h1><em>Drumming</em> is VERY fun!</h1>
        <p>Once you know what you are doing, drumming can be very fun.</p>

        <h2>Equipment</h2>
        <p> New equipment can be very expensive, so try and get it used from people you know or from second-hane stores.</p>

        <h2>Types of Drums and Cymbals</h2>

        <p>It can be confusing when you don't know what type of drum or cymbal you want to be hitting.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-Hat:</strong> this pair of symbals are on top of each other and have a pedal to open and close the cymbals.</li>
            <li><strong>Snare Drum:</strong> The snare is good for adding something at the end of a beat to make it less basic.</li>
            <li><strong>Base Drum:</strong> This is used using a pedal and is used for a similar purpose as the snare.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>How to start drumming</h2>
        <p>I recommend following these steps to start drumming:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Look online for tutorials and videos of people drumming.</li>
            <li>Practice basic techniques like how to hold the sticks.</li>
            <li>Start practicing alone and be prepared to fail.</li>

        </ol>
